# Deployment Checklist

## ✅ What WILL Work on Vercel/Render.com

### Backend API (Node.js/Express)
- ✅ REST API endpoints for authentication, issues, categories
- ✅ MongoDB database connection
- ✅ JWT authentication
- ✅ File upload handling
- ✅ CORS enabled for cross-origin requests
- ✅ Error handling middleware
- ✅ Health check endpoint

## ❌ What will NOT work

### Android App Frontend
- ❌ The Android app interface (Kotlin/Jetpack Compose) cannot run on web platforms
- ❌ You cannot access the app UI through a web browser
- ❌ The frontend is designed for Android devices only

## 🔧 What You Need to Do

### For Render.com Deployment:

1. **Set up MongoDB Atlas** (Free database)
   - Create account at mongodb.com/atlas
   - Create M0 free cluster
   - Get connection string

2. **Deploy Backend to Render.com**
   - Connect GitHub repository
   - Set environment variables
   - Deploy as Node.js service

3. **Update Android App**
   - Change API base URL to your Render.com URL
   - Test API connectivity

4. **Test Everything**
   - Test API endpoints
   - Test Android app with new API URL

## 📱 How to Use After Deployment

1. **Backend API**: Will be accessible at `https://your-app.onrender.com`
2. **Android App**: Install on Android device and connect to deployed API
3. **No Web Interface**: There's no web-based frontend to access

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Test your deployed API
curl https://your-app.onrender.com/health

# Test API endpoints
curl https://your-app.onrender.com/api/v1/categories
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Free Tier Limits**: Render.com free tier has cold starts and 750 hours/month
- **File Storage**: Consider Cloudinary for image uploads in production
- **Performance**: Free tier may be slow for first requests
- **Android Only**: Users need Android devices to use your app

## 🎯 Success Criteria

✅ Backend API responds to requests  
✅ Android app connects to deployed API  
✅ All CRUD operations work  
✅ Authentication works  
✅ File uploads work (with proper storage)  

Your project is well-structured for deployment! The backend will work perfectly, but remember the frontend is Android-only.
